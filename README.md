A centralized repository to debug my academic performance across STEM, Business, and Languages. Built on Linux, managed via Obsidian, and version-controlled by Git.

## 🚀 Subject-Specific Debugging Strategies

### 🧪 STEM (Physics, Chemistry, Math)
- **Focus**: Quantitative precision and Command Terms.
- **Goal**: Minimize "technical debt" (unit errors, calculation slips).
- **Tool**: LaTeX ($$E = mc^2$$) and Excalidraw for molecular/force diagrams.

### 📊 Business Management
- **Focus**: Application of theory to case studies.
- **Goal**: Mastering the multi-perspective analysis (STEEPLE, SWOT).
- **Tool**: Mermaid.js for organizational charts and decision trees.

### ✍️ Languages (Chinese A, English B)
- **Focus**: Stylistic refinement and textual analysis.
- **Goal**: Upgrading "Low-level" vocabulary to "Academic" register.
- **Tool**: Comparison tables (Old Phrase vs. Enhanced Phrase).

## 🛠️ Linux Workflow
1. **Capture**: `Flameshot` for instant exam paper snippets.
2. **Edit**: `Obsidian 1.11.5` for Markdown & LaTeX.
3. **Sync**: `git-push` on vault close via Obsidian-Git plugin.
